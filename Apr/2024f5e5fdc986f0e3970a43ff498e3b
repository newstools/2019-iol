Twenty African Union (AU) member-states have ratified the agreement and deposited the necessary instruments, according to Dr Halima Noor Abdi, a senior official of the African Union Commission (AUC).

Last week the agreement was ratified by Chad, Congo, Djibouti, Egypt, eSwatini, Ethiopia Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Ivory Coast, Kenya, Mali, Mauritania, Namibia, Niger, Rwanda, Senegal, South Africa, Togo and Uganda. Kenya was the first EAC partner state to sign and ratify the agreement. Tanzania, Burundi and South Sudan have signed the agreement, but are yet to ratify it. With the exception of Benin, Eritrea and Nigeria, all the remaining 52 AU member states have signed the agreement. - African News Agency (ANA)

SayHi, for its part, is South Africa’s leading specialist in outbound Automated Voice Marketing (AVM). Together, these two voice industry leaders are able to offer local brands cost-effective ways to automate call centre-based campaigns centred on professionally-recorded 10 to 45 second voice marketing messages. "SayHi and DialFire’s collaboration ticks all the voice marketing boxes. SA brands and their agencies will find our real-time voice campaign solutions enable them to communicate directly with qualified consumers in a way that gets noticed and slashes telecoms marketing costs while offering outstanding ROI," said Stefano Sessa, SayHi managing director. SayHi’s strengths include relationships with all local telecoms operators, proven business intelligence tools and proprietary platforms with the ability to instantly transmit or validate any personal information sent by current or potential clients. Sylvia Hartinger of DialFire believes the South African market is particularly exciting.

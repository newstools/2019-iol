REDMOND â€” Authorities say a 20-month-old boy survived a six-story fall from suburban Seattle apartment window after the toddler landed on the roof of a parked car that cushioned the impact of the plunge. Redmond police spokesman James Perry told the KIRO television station that the toddler "landed in a way where the car absorbed enough of the impact that he was awake and crying when paramedics arrived" Wednesday afternoon. The boy was in serious but stable condition at a hospital. Perry said the toddler was alone in a bedroom, while his mother and two siblings were in another room. Investigators believe the boy propped himself on the edge of a window that was cracked open, pushed through a screen and tumbled about 60 feet (18 metres). AP

Elsewhere, the Chinese yuan drifted lower versus the dollar as the latest round of Sino-US trade talks are also scheduled to take place today. At the close of local trade, the rand quoted 0.4 percent stronger at R14.30/$, after trading in range of R14.29/$ - R14.37/$. The rand traded slightly weaker overnight.

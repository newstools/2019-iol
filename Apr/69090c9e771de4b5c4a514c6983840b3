JOHANNESBURG - The rand drifted stronger as it awaited directional guidance from Moody’s rating action, which was slated for Friday evening according to NKC Research. The rating agency however, delayed publication without providing a reason for not keeping to the indicative scheduling date, causing the rand to strengthen. Our baseline expectation was for the country’s credit rating to remain unchanged at Baa3 (lowest investment grade level), with the outlook revised from stable to negative. At the close of local trade, the rand quoted 0.8 percent stronger at R14.47/$, after trading in range of R14.43/$ - R14.61/$. The rand traded firmer overnight.

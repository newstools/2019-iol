JOHANNESBURG - The rand whipsawed during yesterday’ European session as warning lights flashed in the wake of Eskom’s debt dilemma, although some global trade optimism tempered souring risk sentiment according to NKC Research. The South African unit reacted negatively to news that embattled parastatal Eskom will require more financial support, while the greenback was buoyed by news that weekly US jobless claims dropped to a new half-century low of 202,000. However, the rand clawed back losses later in the session. At the close of local trade, the rand quoted 0.2 percent stronger at R14.11/$, after trading in range of R14.09/$ - R14.22/$. The rand traded little changed overnight. Expected range today R14.00/$ - R14.20/$ South African bourse The JSE All Share (-0.4 percent) ended lower yesterday dragged by large mining (-1.7 percent) and retail (-1.0 percent) shares.

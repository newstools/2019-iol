At 5pm, the rand bid at R14.0646 to the dollar, 9cents softer than at the same time on Wednesday, falling alongside its emerging market peers as global risk demand faded. The rand eked out gains in the previous session after retail sales came in weak but better than forecasts, offering hope the economy could shake off the impact of nationwide power outages over February and March. The central bank, however, warned late on Wednesday that should the rolling blackouts persist throughout the year, it may knock 1.1percentage off gross domestic product, leaving Africaâ€™s most industrialised economy facing possible recession. With local markets closed on Friday and yesterday, liquidity wass set to be tight, with the rand likely to struggle to find momentum to drive it significantly below R14, traders said.

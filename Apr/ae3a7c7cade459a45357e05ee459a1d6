Wellington - New Zealand police arrested a 33-year-old man on Tuesday after reports of suspicious items at a property in Christchurch. Cordons had been put in place in a residential area in the afternoon and the bomb disposal unit was in attendance,Â a police spokesperson said in a statement. Houses in the neighbouring streets were evacuated as a precaution. A man had been arrested and was speaking with police about the incident, the statement said. One resident told the New Zealand Herald there was a "big" police presence. "There's an empty section which is full of police cars and police, lots of them," she said. "A fire engine was parked opposite but that's all I know - there's something going on."

A California man who deliberately drove into a crowd of people, injuring eight, did so because he thought they were Muslim, police said on Friday. The driver, 34-year-old Isaiah Peoples, reportedly targeted the family solely on their appearance, according to police in Sunnyvale, near San Francisco, who are now treating the case as a "hate crime". "There is new evidence that Peoples intentionally targeted victims based on their race and belief that they were Muslim," said Sunnyvale Public Security in a statement. According to local media, three members of the same family are among the eight pedestrians injured on Tuesday - a father and his son and daughter. The nationality and religion of the family have not been released.  A lawyer for Peoples said the incident "was clearly the result of a mental disorder", and he would seek psychiatric treatment for his client -- who he described as a military veteran possibly suffering from post traumatic stress disorder.

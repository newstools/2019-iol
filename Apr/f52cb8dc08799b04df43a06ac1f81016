Durban - A police officer was shot dead when he stopped a suspicious vehicle on the M19 at Reservoir Hills in Durban early on Sunday afternoon, paramedics said. Rescue Care paramedics were alerted shortly after 12pm about a shooting incident on the M19 near the Mountbatten Drive off-ramp, Rescue Care spokesman Garrith Jamieson said. "On arrival, members [paramedics] were faced with the fatal shooting of a policeman who had been shot multiple times in his upper body. It is alleged that he stopped to search a vehicle and the occupants of the vehicle opened fire on him.

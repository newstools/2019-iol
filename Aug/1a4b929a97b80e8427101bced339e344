DURBAN – Food ordering and delivery service platform Uber Eats has launched its pick-up feature in South Africa. "We want to support the growth of the restaurant industry and make our local communities more economically vibrant places to do business. That’s why we’re launching a new service to help bricks and mortar restaurants grow their business while providing users with a quick and convenient way to access food on-the-go. Whether that’s grabbing a coffee on the way to work or skipping the queue during the lunchtime rush," said Ailyssa Pretorius, General Manager, Uber Eats South Africa.

In the South Africa market, Uber Eats began piloting the service with users in Johannesburg who used the Uber Eats app to pick-up at just under 400 restaurants.

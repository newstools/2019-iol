So the internet found itself blown away by American Sign Language (ASL) interpreter,Â Amber Galloway Gallego who was keeping up with Twista, while not saying a single word. While at a recent rap performance in Charlotte, Gallego was able to keep up with the Chicago rapper, bringing the heat with the dexterity of her signing skills. Gallego specializes in the interpretation of concerts and music festivals, especially rap/hip-hop, into ASL and has been described as one of the most recognizable sign language interpreters in the US. She has also signed for hundreds of artists such as the Red Hot Chili Peppers and Snoop Dogg.

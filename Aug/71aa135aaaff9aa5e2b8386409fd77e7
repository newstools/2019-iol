Kabul - At least 17 people were injured after multiple explosions triggered by previously placed explosive devicesÂ in Afghanistan's eastern Nangarhar province on Monday. The explosion in two parts of Jalalabad city, the capital of the province, took place as people were heading out to celebrate the centenary of Afghanistan's independence from the British, the media office of Nangarhar's governor said. The statement added that six explosions had taken place, while six previously placed explosive devices were found and defused by Afghan security forces. Ten of the 17 people injured in the incident were sent home after treatment, the statement said.   Both Islamic State and the Taliban are active in Nangarhar. The province is the birthplace of Islamic State and home to the terrorist group since its emergence in Afghanistan in early 2015.

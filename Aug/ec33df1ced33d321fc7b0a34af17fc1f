Port Elizabeth - President Cyril Ramaphosa will attend the Peace and Reconciliation Agreement ceremony in Maputo, Mozambique, on Tuesday, Presidency said in a statement on Monday.

The fighting between Renamo and government forces has continued for more than a decade, media reports say. "South Africa and Mozambique share cordial and fraternal bilateral, political, economic and social relations underpinned by strong historical ties dating back from the years of the liberation struggle," the statement said. "South Africaâ€™s attendance of the signing ceremony in Mozambique is in solidarity with the people of Mozambique and in support of peace and stability in the country."

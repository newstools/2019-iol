JOHANNESBURG â€“ When it comes to building and growing your company's client base, turnover, geographical reach and reputation, your professional network is your most essential asset. In the world of business, it is not just about what but who you know. This is where networking comes in. Strategically expanding your contact network by attending the right events at the right venue at the right time may take time and effort, but it is worth it. You should see networking as a part of a long-term investment in your business. This is why:   That is not to say that platforms like LinkedIn are useless, as they allow you to connect with individuals you wouldn't have connected with otherwise. David Seinker is the chief executive of the Business Exchange. BUSINESS REPORT

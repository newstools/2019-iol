Carletonville - A nine-year-old girl was hospitalised following a freak accident at a school in Carletonville, ER24 said in a statement on Tuesday. "ER24 medics arrived on the scene at 3pm to find that a nine-year-old girl had impaled her hand on a palisade fence. Members of the public had gathered and were assisting the young patient." The medics used a grinder supplied by a member of the public to remove a section of the fence, freeing the girl before they treated her at the scene, and then took her to a nearby hospital, ER24 said. The girl had apparently tried to climb over the fence when she slipped and fell. Exact details of the incident are not known, ER24 said. African News Agency (ANA)

Here are some tips from Instagram about how to become a hashtag master: Less is more: Don’t use too many hashtags per feed post - focus on the ones that are most relevant. Focus on specifics: With a generic hashtag, your post will be harder to find. For example, posting #Labrador rather than #dog will help fans of the breed find your post. Add hashtags to your bio: You can add hashtags to your Instagram bio, making your profile more discoverable for people who share your interests. Find related hashtags: Type a hashtag into the app’s search bar, and then select “tags” from the dropdown menu to see the top hashtags that are closely related to it.

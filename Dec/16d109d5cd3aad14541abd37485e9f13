The tree was inspired by art deco, most ornaments were the colour palette of peacock feathers hence why I did this 2 peacock number with 400 cupcakes, well there were alot of guests folks as you can see, we did 200 cupcakes replenished twice and they went in 3 mins per 200, is that a world record? 🤔 I was lucky enough to have @kempinskibahia pastry team pre bake the cupcakes and assist with the decorating. After all 400 for one woman, tis abit of an ask! #caketress #cakeart #pastryteam #teamwork #luxurycakes #grandcakes #cakequeen #couturetocakes #couturiertocaketress #fondant #thesugarpaste #sugarwork #thecakedecoratingcompany #sugarartist #cakeartist #cakeoftheweek #igcakes #celebritycakeartist All edible materials provided by @the_cake_decorating_co My fondant of choice @thesugarpaste Cake stand @alessandro__galanti A post shared by  Debbie wingham (@debbie_wingham) on Dec 8, 2019 at 12:30am PST   L'albero di Natale più grande al mondo è in Italia e precisamente in Umbria. È costituito da oltre 800 corpi luminosi disseminati lungo le pendici del monte Ingino a valle del quale sorge la città medievale di Gubbio. In foto il momento in cui è stato acceso, qualche giorno fa, con tanto di fuochi d'artificio. Voi lo avete visto di persona? . #youmeteo #alberodinatale #gubbio #umbria #natale #monteingino #meteo #christmastree #christmas2019 #natale2019 #stellacometa Photo credit @francesco_tini_ A post shared by  youmeteo.com (@youmeteo) on Dec 10, 2019 at 9:27am PST

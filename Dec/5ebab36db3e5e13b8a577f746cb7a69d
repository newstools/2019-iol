Facility staff immediately informed SAPS, at approximately 5pm, and police were on the scene within six minutes, where the group that attempted the assault was picked up.” He says the next day one of the boys, that were taken away by police the previous day, returned to the pool and attempted to stab a boy. “He was apprehended inside the facility by the facility security personnel for attempting to assault another person. “At the time of the incident, there were three security officers, three facility protection officers and three access controllers. “No incidents were reported of anyone being hurt, and the suspect is under the consultation of SAPS.” Law Enforcement spokesperson, Wayne Dyason, confirms that officers arrived at the pool, but says the perpetrator was taken away by Philippi police.

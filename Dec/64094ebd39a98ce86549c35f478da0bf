Violent Clashes In Delhi's Seelampur Over Citizenship Act Fresh protests erupted across the nation against Citizenship Amendment Act including fresh violence in North East Delhi where protesters burned down a police picket and caused damage to public property. An opposition delegation led by Sonia Gandhi... A large group gathered at Jantar Mantar in the heart of Delhi shouting slogans against the citizenship law and offering roses to the police to show they were protesting peacefully. At least 18 metro stations in a wide swathe of central and old Delhi where demonstrations were planned have been closed. Police set up barricades at the borders of Delhi and were screening passengers, which led to massive traffic jams. Voice, messaging and data services and internet were snapped in certain areas of Delhi by service providers, complying with a government order. Protests were taking place in Chandigarh, Lucknow, Hyderabad, Kolkata, Mangalore and Bhopal among several other cities in 10 states across India, NDTV reported. Bans on gatherings of more than five people have been in place in most cities since early morning where police say they refused permission to hold protests. "Our constitution gives us the right to protest. This is like a police state," said a young student Rishabh Singh who was trying to reach the Red Fort in Delhi. The controversial Citizenship Amendment Act approved last week makes it easier for non-Muslim illegal migrants from three-Muslim majority countries - Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan - to acquire Indian citizenship if they are facing religious persecution. Critics say it goes against India's secular constitution by making religion a basis for granting citizenship. The ruling Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party says it will not affect any citizen of India - including Muslims - but is only aimed at giving relief to those who have fled religious persecution in the three Muslim majority countries. The citizenship law has seen a spate of violent protests in the country over the past week, including in the north-eastern statesÂ  bordering Bangladesh where ethnic tribal communities fear an influx of migrants across their borders with Bangladesh.

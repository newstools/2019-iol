Rustenburg - The only survivor of the N4 crash outside Rustenburg died in hospital, North West Community Safety and Transport Management member of the executive council (MEC) Sello Lehari said on Friday. "It is with a heavy heart that we learn today [Friday] that the only survivor who sustained serious injuries emanating from the N4, Moedwil/Rustenburg, fatal crash has sadly succumbed to death too. The accident tally rises to six with two of these being Pakistani nationals," he said in a statement. Five people died on Thursday when two cars collided head-on, they died at the scene and jaws-of-life was used to remove them from the wreckage.

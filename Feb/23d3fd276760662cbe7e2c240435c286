A man who claimed he went to heaven and took selfies with God is now condemning pastor Ralph Lukau for faking Ressurection miracles. Just a thief fighting another thief. As Africans, these are the men we glorify. Issa pity pic.twitter.com/9pX16NiKfj   #Mboro Pastor Mboro: ‘I prayed the toddler back to life and the paramedic killed her’.

INTERNATIONAL – Volkswagen’s truck and bus division increased its adjusted full-year operating profit last year by 13 percent thanks to a Brazilian market recovery, efficiency measures at MAN and a rise in vehicle deliveries. Traton said on Monday it expects a return on sales of between 6.5 percent and 7.5 percent in 2019 as well as a slight increase in revenue and vehicle deliveries adding that an efficiency and cost cutting drive at MAN will continue. Traton’s 2018 return on sales was 6.4 percent, up from 6 percent in 2017, while its adjusted operating profit rose to 1.7 billion euros on revenue of 25.9 billion euros ($29 billion), which was up by 6 percent on a year earlier. Volkswagen Caminhoes e Onibus, Traton’s Brazilian business, rebounded last year, with a 22 percent jump in revenue helping it to return to an operating profit of 28 million euros. Traton said it sold 233,000 vehicles of the MAN, Scania and Volkswagen Caminhoes e Onibus brands, 14 percent more than 2017.

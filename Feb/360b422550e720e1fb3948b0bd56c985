CAPE TOWN – Ahead of the Mobile World Congress which is set to take place in Barcelona, Samsung is set to launch its next smartphone on Wednesday the 20th of February at a Galaxy Unpacked event. The smartphone appears to be the Galaxy S10 which according to rumours will be available in three handsets which will be a 6.4inch, 6.1inch and 5.8inch variant. The two bigger handsets will reportedly feature in-display fingerprint scanners due to the lack of a physical scanner. According to a specifications sheet posted by GSMArena, the larger devices will feature Samsung’s new Infinity O hole-punch display. The S10 and S10 Plus will both have AMOLED Gorilla Glass 6 panels at 3040 x 1440 QHD+ resolution and the S10 Plus will have an additional front-facing camera. According to a report by SamMobile,  Samsung may be releasing another 5G-equipped variant of the S10 called the Galaxy S10 X. A rumour byThe Wall Street Journal back in November claimed that Samsung was working on a supersized 5G phone code-named “Beyond X”, which was said to offer a massive 6.7-inch display, a total of six cameras and support for 5G. SamMobile also claims that the S10 X will offer a 5,000mAh battery and a minimum of 256GB of storage by default. Other rumours also mentioned that the company would also release a folding phone that will unfold from a 4.58-inch candy bar form factor into a 7.3-inch tablet screen, which Samsung calls its Infinity Flex Display and is rumored to be called the Galaxy F.

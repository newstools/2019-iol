CAPE TOWN – Finance Minister Tito Mboweni turned a deaf ear to the tobacco industry’s desperate calls to not increase the interest on tobbacco from their current level. The minister, however, announced that there would be a special unit focused on tax evasion in order to ensure maximum tax revenue is realised. “Fiscal prudence requires some tax changes. We propose additional revenue measures of R15 billion in 2019/20. There will be a slight upward adjustment of the tax-free threshold for personal income taxes, with no change in the current personal income tax brackets. Together these will raise R12.8 billion. Madam Speaker, excise duties on alcohol and tobacco will be increased, as follows:   The Black Tobacco Farmers Association (BTFA) called for government to keep excise taxes at their current level, which it said was inspired by the current incapacity by the SA Revenue Service (Sars) to effectively tackle the illicit trade of cigarettes in order to protect farmers from a threat of job losses.

Cape Town - A fire broke out on the lower slopes of Table Mountain just after 6pm on Friday evening. The City of Cape Town's fire chief Theo Layne said it was a large vegetation fire, adding that it poses no danger to property. The fire was fanned by a strong south-easterly wind. Scores of firefighters were on the scene, battling the raging flames and helicopters water bombed in a bid to extinguish the fire. Many took to social media expressing concern for residents living nearby and firefighters.   #capetownfire seen from Century City. This is heart of Cape Town.

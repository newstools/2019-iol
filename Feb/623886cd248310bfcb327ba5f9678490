READ: SA to develop Africa’s largest tech hub This is the view of Dr Iqbal Survé, chairperson of Sekunjalo, who says with its vast pool of unemployed young people, South Africa cannot afford to miss investing in these sectors. "This is our opportunity to skill up young people to participate in the technology revolution otherwise called the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR). In South Africa, the legacy sectors such as mining, retail and property are what investors are used to. The future is right here, Africa cannot afford to hand over control and management of information, content and commerce to the world’s most powerful technology companies.

Africa must use its immensely gifted young talent, to develop platforms, systems and populate these with consumers thus using the opportunity to make a quantum leap into the fourth industrial revolution.

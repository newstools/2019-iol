CAPE TOWN – A forecast by World Wide Worx shows that online retail sales figures in South Africa are expected to more than double from 2016 to almost R20-billion by 2020. As such, South African small and medium enterprises (SMEs) operating in the retail sector should start to consider entering into the e-commerce space – an industry poised for growth as millennials and digital Generation Z, who have been dubbed digital natives, begin to make up an increasingly large portion of consumers. This is according to David Morobe, regional general manager at Business Partners Limited (BUSINESS/PARTNERS) who says that SMEs with wholesale/retail operations made up the largest non-financial sector in South Africa according to the 2018 State Entrepreneurship Survey. “With this in mind, as the country moves further into the Fourth Industrial Revolution and access to the internet continues to increase, business owners should start planning now for when the e-commerce industry booms.” Morobe says that although it may seem daunting to add this element to a retail business, it is a lucrative investment for small business owners to consider for the future. “As consumers continue to demand that most things be available at the click of the mouse, small business owners should start considering how they can innovate and adapt to remain competitive, not only with other small businesses but also with large corporates.” As such, Morobe provides points for SMEs to consider when planning to start or implement an e-commerce platform for their businesses:   Morobe points out that SMEs who own brick and mortar stores, however, should not necessarily migrate completely to an online platform, but should rather consider this as an addition to their offering. “As the country is still rolling out infrastructure to increase access to internet as well as working towards lowering the cost of data, there is room for a retailer to have both options to ensure that they are reaching the highest number of customers as possible,” concludes Morobe.

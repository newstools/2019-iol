CAPE TOWN – LG on Wednesday revealed more pre-announcements of the  G8 ThinQ which is set to officially launch at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona next week. This time around, the company decided to reveal news on the phone’s audio features which is that the device will use “Crystal Sound OLED” that LG has used on some of its TVs before; this means that the entire display will vibrate to work as a speaker.

INTERNATIONAL - Marlboro maker Altria said on Tuesday it would issue bonds in the United States to help fund its purchase of a stake in fast-growing e-cigarette company Juul, a day after announcing a similar move in the European bond market. The Richmond, Virginia-based tobacco company will issue the US bonds in six tranches in denominations of $2,000 as it looks to pre-pay a term loan arranged by JPMorgan Chase, Altria said in a regulatory filing. Altria said in December it was using a nearly $15 billion term-loan facility with JPMorgan to finance the $12.8 billion price tag for a 35 percent stake in Juul Labs Inc. The loan matures in December this year. The money being raised will support Altriaâ€™s purchase of Juul as well as Canadian cannabis producer Cronos Group, which it announced in December. Its European bond issue is expected to raise 4.25 billion euros ($4.80 billion) in a four-part sale.

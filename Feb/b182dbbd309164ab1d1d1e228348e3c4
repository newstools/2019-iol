 It’s not going to get top marks in geography – but one pupil’s prank has certainly put his school on the map. For a mischievous youngster has managed to rename his Yorkshire school on Google maps as a ‘prison’ and ‘hell on earth’. To the bemusement of staff, Hornsea School and Language College began to appear as ‘Hornsea Prison & Hell On Earth’. The pupil is thought to have tricked the search engine by inputting bogus data, according to the BBC. Although the listing is now being removed, a Facebook page still refers to the East Riding school as Hornsea Prison & Language College. The school said it knew who the prankster was. Headteacher Steve Ostler warned: ‘We recommend that all schools take ownership of their Google map icon to prevent any copycat behaviours.’

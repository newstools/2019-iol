JOHANNESBURG – I am appalled by the lies and disinformation published in the Daily Maverick by Sam Sole of Amabhungane and repeated by others. At no stage did I receive any personal benefit from shares in AYO Technology Solutions (AYO), nor did I receive any dividends from AYO. This can be confirmed with AYO as well as via my personal bank accounts. If R900 000 was paid into my bank account as alleged, I would be the first to know. These are complete lies and disinformation. For the record, herewith the following:   I have spent my entire life as a man of integrity, as someone who has fought for workers’ and employees’ rights. I have fought against corruption and I continue to do so. I am shocked that such disinformation and deliberate misrepresentation of my position in the facilitation of AYO shares to workers is being misconstrued.

Pretoria - The Economic Freedom Fighters has pledged to respond to community calls for better health care, job opportunities, and fighting crime ahead of the party's 2019 elections manifesto launch in Soshanguve, north of Pretoria on Saturday. EFF deputy secretary general Hlengiwe Hlophe-Maxon said the party's manifesto was the result of engagements with communities in sectoral and stakeholder meetings in November and December. "The issues that emanated from those consultations [are] the issues of corruption, job opportunities, diseases, clinics and healthcare, [and] shortages [in] education, especially schools." "Those are the typical issues that suggest that there is still a crisis in South Africa. So we took those issues and drafted our manifesto on the basis of what the communities told us," she said.

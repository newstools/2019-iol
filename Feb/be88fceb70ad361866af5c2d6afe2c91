JOHANNESBURG - The rand dipped slightly lower against the greenback during yesterday’s European trading session according to NKC Research. The local currency looked seemingly stable as it recovered from the previous week’s slide. The rand is likely to stay rangebound in the coming days as investors wait patiently for Wednesday’s National Budget speech, and with US markets closed yesterday, while investors remain hopeful that the US and China can settle a trade dispute. At close of local trade, the rand quoted 0.5 percent weaker at R14.12/$, after trading in range of R14.04/$ - R14.13/$. The rand traded lower overnight. Expected range today R14.00/$ - R14.30/$.

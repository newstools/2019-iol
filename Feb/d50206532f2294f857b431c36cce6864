JOHANNESBURG - The rand traded sideways against the greenback during European trade on Tuesday according to NKC Research.

At the close of local trade, the rand quoted 0.02 percent weaker at R13.85/$, after trading in range of R13.83/$ - R13.89/$. The rand remained flat overnight. Expected range today R13.75/$ - R13.95/$. South African bourse The JSE All Share (+0.7 percent) ended higher yesterday, led by gains in mining and consumer goods shares.

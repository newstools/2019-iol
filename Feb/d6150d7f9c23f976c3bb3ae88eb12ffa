"The inclusion of Moab Khotsong and Hidden Valley in our asset portfolio has boosted the company’s production and cash flow in the first half of the 2019 financial year, demonstrating the quality of these assets in line with our investment strategy," CEO Peter Steenkamp said. "We remain committed to our strategy of producing safe, profitable ounces and increasing our margins to ensure our operations benefit from the positive sentiment in the gold market."

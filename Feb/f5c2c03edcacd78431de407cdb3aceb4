JOHANNESBURG - A new concept hotel with the City Lodge Hotel Groupâ€™s brand is to be developed in Waterfall City in Midrand. Construction of the 168-room hotel in terms of a land and building lease agreement with JSE-listed property company Attacq and the Barrow Group, was expected to commence next month with completion expected in October next year. The hotel will feature 10 levels and include a rooftop bar/function area and a 100-seater conference facility, have 160 rooms and eight suites, meeting rooms, a swimming pool and a gym.

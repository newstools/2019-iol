Watertown, New York - Four children and their father were killed in a fire that ripped through their northern New York home. Hundreds of people gathered in Watertown for a vigil Friday night to Aaron Bodah and daughters Skylar, Erin, Alexa and Merissa. The girls ranged in age from 4 to 14. Investigators say it appears the fire started in the kitchen around 1:30 am on Thursday. They said pots were left on the electric stove and smoke detectors had no batteries. A fifth daughter escaped and ran to neighbours for help. She was taken to a hospital. WWNY-TV reported Friday that she was back in Watertown. Authorities say Aaron Bodah's brother lived in the house and was at work when the fire started. Mourners placed flowers at a makeshift memorial and released balloons. AP ___ Information from: WWNY-TV,

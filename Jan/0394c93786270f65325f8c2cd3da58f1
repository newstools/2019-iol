KHUMA - Late Bafana Bafana legend Philemon Masinga will be buried at his hometown of Khuma in Stilfontein near Klerksdorp in North West on Thursday. The former Bafana Bafana player lost his battle against cancer on 13 January at a Johannesburg hospital at the age of 49. North West Sport Development MEC Sello Lehari told mourners at a memorial service that he would discuss with relevant stakeholders renaming the Khuma stadium after Masinga and erecting a statue in his memory. “Philemon Masinga was (the) core of the premier soccer players, one of the best strikers ever to be produced by the North West province and South Africa. “As a province we pride ourselves on the achievement the late Philemon Masinga made and as such his legacy will forever remain. "We will consult and engage with relevant stakeholders and the department including the local municipality with a view of erecting a statue for the late Philemon Masinga and to rename Khuma, this stadium, after him as a gesture of honouring him,” Lehari said.

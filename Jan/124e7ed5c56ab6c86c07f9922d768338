Rustenburg - A man -- who was apart of the six awaiting trial prisoners who escaped from lawful custody at the Hartbeespoordam police station -- was re-arrested while he was attempting to skip the country, North West police said on Tuesday. Captain Sam Tselanyane said Charles Chauke was re-arrested on Monday, through an intelligence-driven operation. Chauke was arrested in a taxi on the N4 road between Rustenburg and Marikana. "The taxi was en route to Mozambique. Chauke was in detention for multiple counts of house robbery that were committed in Scheerpoort when he escaped," Tselenyane said. Another escapee Talent Machinda, 25, was re-arrested at Matshelapad informal settlement in Broederstroom on December 30.

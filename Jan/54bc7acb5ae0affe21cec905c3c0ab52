CAPE TOWN – Vodacom announced on Tuesday that it had secured the rights to livestream the 2018/19 FA Cup through its Video Play platform starting at the price of R35 per match. Customers are also given the option to purchase a Full Pass which gives them access to all live games, delayed games and highlights. Vodacom said in a statement: “We are aware that soccer fans are passionate and have the spirit to connect with one another when watching a game. We are also aware that many fans face the challenges that comes with the costs of high monthly pay TV subscription costs.

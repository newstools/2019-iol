Johannesburg - A woman, believed to be in her 50s, sustained several fractures on Monday, after a wall collapsed on her in Olievenhoutbosch, paramedics said. ER24 spokesperson Werner Vermaak said that at around 10.30am, paramedics arrived on the scene where they found the woman near the collapsed wall.

Microsoft is now recommending that Windows 10 Mobile users move to iOS or Android devices. Microsoft said in a statement: "With the Windows 10 Mobile OS end of support, we recommend that customers move to a supported Android or iOS device. Some services including photo uploads and restoring a device from an existing device backup may continue to work for up to another 12 months from end of support.” The company added that device backups for settings and some apps will continue for three months until March 10th, 2020.

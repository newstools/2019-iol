North West Heatlh MEC Madodo Sambatha welcomed the interns at Klerksdorp Hospital during their orientation. Sambatha said the health sector was in need of additional health professional and the presence of new health officials would help speed up health service delivery in the province. "I am not going to accept that a patient has no bed. Patients do not admit themselves. They are admitted by health professionals who clearly prescribe the level of health care service, intervention and ultimate admission. "It is the responsibility of management of the hospital to make sure that the beds are available during the time of need, including necessary medical tools to make work of health professionals easier to execute," Sambatha said.

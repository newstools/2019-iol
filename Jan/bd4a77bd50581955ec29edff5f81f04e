MAIDUGURI â€” Nigeria's Chief Justice is scheduled to be arraigned at the Code of Conduct Tribunal in Abuja on charges of failing to declare his assets and for holding foreign bank accounts. The federal government ordered Justice Walter Samuel Nkanu Onnoghen to immediately vacate his office as head of the country's judiciary Saturday. The Chief Justice has a key role in resolving election disputes and Nigeria will vote for a new president in February. This is the first time a Nigerian Chief Justice is standing trial. On Monday a team of 94 lawyers arrived at the tribunal to defend Onnoghen, whose appointment had suffered unprecedented delay by President Muhammadu Buhari. The Coalition of Niger Delta Agitators argues that Onnoghen is being wrongly prosecuted and threatened to resume attacks on oil wells. Associated Press

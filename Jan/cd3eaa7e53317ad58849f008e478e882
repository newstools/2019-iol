Durban - A 29-year-old man drowned while swimming at a community pool in Buffelsdale in Tongaat, north of Durban on Tuesday, security company Reaction Unit South Africa said. "At approximately 13:15 today [Tuesday] medics from Reaction Unit South Africa were called out to the scene by the public after the unresponsive man was pulled out of the pool by a lifeguard. "Upon arrival, Cardio Pulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) was in progress. Paramedics from three private ambulance services took over resuscitation efforts.

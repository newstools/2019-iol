Harare â€” Representatives of Zimbabwe's government workers Tuesday protested against what they called "slave salaries" as inflation almost doubled to 176%, a decade high that highlights the country's rapidly deteriorating economy. Holding placards and singing songs denouncing the country's finance minister, about two dozen union leaders representing teachers, nurses and other government workers gathered in front of the finance ministry offices in central Harare. A few police officers monitored the protest from a distance. Leaders of the civil servants union said government workers would be unable to continue showing up for work if their salaries are not adjusted to match inflation. The inflation rate increased dramatically from 97% in May, according to figures released by the government's statistics agency Monday. Civil servants earn an average of 500 Zimbabwe dollars.

Berlin â€” Sweden's prime minister says he would be glad to speak with US President Donald Trump about rapper A$AP Rocky's detention but he "cannot and will not attempt to influence prosecutors or courts." Trump tweeted on Friday that he would call Prime Minister Stefan Lofven "to see what we can do about helping A$AP Rocky." Rocky has been held in Sweden for weeks as police investigate his alleged involvement in a fight. First lady Melania Trump and celebrities including Kanye West urged Trump to intervene. The Swedish leader said on Saturday he was aware Trump "has a personal interest in the case." Lofven called Trump's desire for a conversation "certainly positive" and said: "I will explain that the Swedish judicial system is independent. In Sweden, everyone is equal before the law, and this includes visitors from other countries." AP

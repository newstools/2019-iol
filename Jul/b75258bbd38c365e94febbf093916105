Justin Hume, Director: Integrated Mobility at Samsung South Africa said in a statement: "Samsung Pay has redefined what consumers can expect from a digital wallet.” “Our ongoing additions such as the Discover Tab takes the convenience even further. Its additional features, promotions, subscription offers and travel deals open up a world of options to users.” Launched last year, Samsung Pay is a mobile payment system that allows users to store a digital version of their bank card on their Samsung device and pay for items by just a swipe, authenticate and tap away.

FNB offers them the right product based on their needs and behaviour". He added that the tough economic conditions have put pressure on households especially those in entry-level income brackets, with consumers having to stretch their budgets even further to meet their monthly obligations. The FNB Connect benefits for Easy equates to the monthly fees on the respective bank accounts, this is a major cost-saving for customers.

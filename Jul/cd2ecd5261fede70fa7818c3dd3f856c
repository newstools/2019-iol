MultiChoice completed its first engagement with relevant stakeholders on Friday, the company said. The company was encouraged by the full attendance of all the role players, including trade union representatives from the Communications Workers’ Union, Media Workers’ Association of South Africa, and the Information Communication Technology Union, as well MultiChoice’s own Work Place Forum. “We respect the spirit that prevailed in the meeting which was one of open conversations and candour. As a responsible employer, we are empathetic to the plight of the employees that are being consulted as part of the proposed restructuring process. We are encouraged that the relevant labour unions share the same views around ensuring the well-being of our employees as we consult on a very difficult process,” MultiChoice group executive for corporate affairs Joe Heshu said. MultiChoice was committed to considering the initial feedback received during Friday's meeting, with an agreement to respond to the various employee representatives today, as the company continued seeking consensus. The company looked forward to further engagements with labour unions as well as the WPF, the statement said. African News Agency (ANA)

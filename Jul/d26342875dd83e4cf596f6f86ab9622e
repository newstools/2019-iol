Durban - Vusi Khoza,  the EFF's party caucus leader in the KwaZulu-Natal legislature, on Thursday said the news that convicted racist Penny Sparrow had died should be celebrated. Sparrow died at the Kingsway Hospital in the early hours of the morning after battling cancer. "Good riddance we say for the passing of Penny Sparrow. Racism is a cancer that kills. Goodbye Penny Sparrow. May you come back and fetch more racists," said Khoza, in his response to KwaZulu-Natal Premier's budget. Sparrow, a former KwaZulu-Natal estate agent, was convicted in the Scottburgh Magistrate’s Court for crimen injuria in relation to racist comments that she made in 2016 comparing black people at the beach to monkeys. Magistrate Vincent Hlatshway handed Sparrow a R5 000 fine, or 12 months imprisonment. National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) spokesperson Natasha Ramkisson-Kara said that Sparrow was sentenced to an additional two years, which was wholly suspended for five years, during which time she must not be convicted of crimen injuria. She was also ordered to make a public apology for her remarks on Facebook – the very platform on which she vented her rage against black South Africans, referring to them as “monkeys”, who if allowed loose on the country’s beaches, would cause “huge dirt and troubles and discomfort to others”.

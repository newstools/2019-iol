THE IFP has lost one of its longest serving senior members, Sibongile Nkomo, after she died following a long illness. Nkomo was the party’s secretary general from 2012 until January 2019 when she stepped down due to ill-health. In a statement, the IFP said Nkomo (63) was a nurse by profession, passed on Saturday evening after a long illness at a Durban hospital. It added that she executed her duties as Secretary General with a high level of professionalism, diligence and efficiency of the highest order. “Ms Nkomo represented the best of IFP leadership in general and woman leadership in particular… Owing to her ill health Ms Nkomo stepped down as the IFP Secretary General in January 2019 in an effort to tend to her health and also give the party an opportunity to focus on the 2019 elections. We had hoped that she would return to good health and continue her servant leadership to the IFP and South Africa,” said the IFP. "Previously Nkomo represented the IFP in the Gauteng legislature where she also chaired the Standing Committee on Public Accounts (Scopa). In 2013 the IFP moved her to the National Assembly until the 8 May 2019 national and provincial elections. "In Parliament she amongst other committees served in finance, home affairs and tourism. Nkomo was a competent, analytical and dedicated Member of Parliament,” said the party. Nkomo had also served the party in various position in Gauteng until she was sent to the National Assembly in 2013. She is survived by her daughter Zama, her mother and four brothers. Political Bureau

It also offers a concierge service, a gym, gourmet kitchen, meeting rooms, air conditioning, luxury finishes throughout, 24 hour state-of-the-art security, basement parking, fibre-to-home and storage units. "The apartment building offers 160 units over 20 floors, and a limited number of units are available for rentals with prices starting from R10 000 per month for one bedroom apartments, and expected to reach a high of over R80 000 for three bedroom penthouse apartments with sky gardens," said Peet Strauss, development manager for Pam Golding Properties in Johannesburg. There will be furnished and unfurnished units, however, they all come standard with integrated Smeg appliances. Strauss explained that the rental apartments will be suitable for young professionals working within the Rosebank node, commuters needing a home base in Johannesburg, young couples starting out, as well as international corporates looking for secure and convenient lifestyle living within the city.

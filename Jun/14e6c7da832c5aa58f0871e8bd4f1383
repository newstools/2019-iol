JOHANNESBURG - A 27-year-old Ugandan woman, Jackline Nakku, will spend 20-years in jail for murdering her husband on Valentine’s Day in 2018. The High Court in Mukono District in central Uganda found her guilty of murdering her husband Eric Kiddu after hitting him several times on the head with an iron bar. After the murder Nakku attempted to make the killing appear to be the result of an attack by unknown people by screaming and running to neighbours to ask for help. His body was later found in a pool of blood with a panga and brick besides it, the Daily Monitor reported. The couple had quarrelled shortly before the bloody encounter with a misunderstanding leading to Kiddu’s death. Nakku was advised by the judge to appeal the sentence if she was dissatisfied as relatives of both husband and wife argued outside the court, trading accusations. African News Agency (ANA)

In 1971 Timol plunged to his death from the 10th floor of the then John Vorster Square Police Station in Johannesburg, where he had been held because of his anti-apartheid activities. The original inquest which was held in 1972 concluded that Timol committed suicide. Most of the evidence was centred around Rodrigues's testimony.     JUST IN: Former apartheid cop Joao Rodrigues, who is accused of murdering activist Ahmed Timol in 1971, has had his application for a permanent stay of prosecution dismissed in the Joburg High Court this morning. Rodrigues WI now be prosecuted by the NPA. @TheStar_news, @iol. pic.twitter.com/NX0DP6Hvh0 Rodrigues claimed at the time that he saw Timol jump out of a window, but he couldn't save him because he tripped over a chair. However, the matter was revisited decades later. In 2017, judge Billy Mothle ruled that Timol did not commit suicide. It was found that Timol was murdered. This led to Rodrigues being charged in July 2018.

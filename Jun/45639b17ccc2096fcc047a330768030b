JOHANNESBURG – Zambian President Edgar Lungu and his ruling Patriotic Front (PF) party will probably remain in power after the next elections in 2021, according to a new report released by the UK based Economics Intelligence Unit. Although the report cited some challenges with the Zambian economy, many of which are not unique to the country, the PF administration had come up with appropriate and timely responses, the Lusaka Times reported on Friday. One of Lungu’s strengths, according to the Unit, is that he continues to inspire investor confidence by ensuring that the mining sector continues to fall under the control of the private sector. Furthermore, there is no credible opposition opposing him.

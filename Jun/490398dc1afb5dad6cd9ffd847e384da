DURBAN - First National Bank (FNB) has been voted as the coolest banking brand for the 8th consecutive year in the Sunday Times Generation Next 2019 survey. "We are truly honoured to have been chosen as the coolest banking brand by the South African youth, for the eighth year running. This is testament to FNB’s commitment to remaining relevant to the youth market by providing customer-centric innovations that have helped create a range of positive customer experiences," said FNB chief marketing officer Faye Mfikwe. The Sunday Times Generation Next survey is conducted by HDI Youth Marketers and recognises South Africa's most-loved brands, products and celebrities in 72 categories voted for by over 5,500 youth aged 8 to 23.

"We have worked hard on building a brand that stands for much more than winning over the youth market but one that defines help as being relevant in whatever context our customers find themselves," said Mfikwe.

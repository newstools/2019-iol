Although phone batteries have come a long way in the past few years, they are still not built to last forever. While smartphones have advanced at a rapid rate, no longer falling prey to underperformance after passing their second birthday, phone batteries can’t offer the same performance over time, simply because they are a consumable component. Like all rechargeable batteries, phone batteries hold less power, and become less effective as they age, which usually starts happening after about 18 to 24 months. Most smartphone batteries offer about 300 to 500 charging cycles. Here are a few signs that it might be time to replace your smartphone battery:  Huawei’s battery replacement offer 1 – 30 June For Huawei smartphone users, an easy battery replacement is within their reach, with Huawei’s special battery replacement promotion from 1 to 30 June.

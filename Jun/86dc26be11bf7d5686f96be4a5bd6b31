Accounting firm BDO said on Wednesday it did not believe that its unqualified audit opinion of AYO Technology Solutions results ending August 31 would change, based upon the information obtained during the agreed upon procedures (AUP). This was contained in a voluntary SENS announcement released by the tech firm where it also stated that it had engaged its external auditors, BDO, to commence with the audit of the 2018 interim results. “On completion of the audit, the company will release restated audited 2018 interim results and provide all the necessary disclosure, as required by international financial reporting standards (IFRS), the Companies Act, and the JSE listings requirements – including full details of the errors in the application of IFRS. "AYO reiterates that it is co-operating fully with the Johannesburg Stock Exchange in addressing matters raised out of both the internal review and the external fact finding report. The company reaffirms it is of the opinion that changes highlighted in the review and the fact finding, do not affect the August 2018 audited results.” BUSINESS REPORT

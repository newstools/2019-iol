 Just like Monday, majority of visitors at Park Opening headed straight for GE, leaving very minimal wait times everywhere else. Fewest crowds I've ever encountered at Disneyland. Even GE didn't feel too crowded by late AM, and wait times for SR 60 min or less throughout PM. https://t.co/vn0LVQs3S1

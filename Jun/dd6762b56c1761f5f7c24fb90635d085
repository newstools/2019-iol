India, in particular, is expected to maintain strong economic growth with the renewed mandate provided to the governing party in the recent elections providing some policy certainty,” the group noted. Sanlam’s affluent and high-net-worth client base had remained cautious in the run-up to the elections, and through the announcement of the new cabinet and any potential policy announcement. At group level new business volumes of R72bn, were up 7percent on the first four months of the 2018 financial year (3percent in constant currency and excluding Saham Finances).

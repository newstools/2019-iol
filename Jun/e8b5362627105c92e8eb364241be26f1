London - With Brexit in limbo following Prime Minister Theresa May's resignation as leader of the ruling Conservatives, all eyes are on the Brexit positions taken by the candidates to succeed her in the party's election contest. Outspoken and gaffe-prone former foreign secretary Boris Johnson, dubbed "Britain's Trump" by some critics, is the strong favourite to be next leader of the party - and the country. Backed by leading Conservative eurosceptics, Johnson consolidated his frontrunner status after this week's first round of voting by the party's lawmakers. He promised a tougher line in negotiations with Brussels and insisted that the possibility of Britain leaving the EU without a deal must remain open.   Gove's leadership bid took a hit after he admitted taking cocaine several times while working as a journalist 20 years ago.   "After three years and two missed deadlines, we must leave the EU on 31 October and we must do better than the current withdrawal agreement that has been rejected three times by parliament," Johnson said. "I don't want a no-deal outcome but I think it is right for our great country to prepare for that outcome."   The Conservative lawmakers will whittle down the list next week to just two candidates to run off in a postal vote by the party's reported 160,000 members, with the result expected in the week beginning July 22.

The idea was sparked by people tweeting photos of products they make, said Jennifer Cohen, the SBI’s executive for policy and advocacy. “I’m always so inspired when I see requests by entrepreneurs for others to re-tweet a photo of something they’ve made with the hope that their next customer is on our timelines,” she said. “The hustle and heart is so typically South African.” The SBI is a national chamber organisation and a member of Business Unity South Africa. The institute said its main focus for this year was to grow its network of business chambers - particularly in small towns and townships - to interact fruitfully with municipalities. The national body advocates discussion and policy around issues of importance to SMEs. The SBI believes that limiting obstacles to entrepreneurial success and sustainability will help South Africa’s economy grow, transform and become more inclusive. The SBI will also be sharing ideas for networking, professional development and notifications from its chamber members, as well as highlighting speakers or panellists at upcoming #SMEIndabas on its social media platforms.

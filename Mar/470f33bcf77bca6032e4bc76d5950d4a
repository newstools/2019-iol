JOHANNESBURG –The Black Business Council (BBC) on Friday congratulated Edward Kieswetter on his appointment as Commissioner of the South African Revenue Service (Sars). BBC president Sandile Zungu said Kieswetter was embarking on a challenging journey. "Sars is an extremely important organisation that needs solid, knowledgeable, capable and tested hands to steer it forward. We are confident that Mr Kieswetter will rebuild Sars and restore its credibility, which is vital for effective tax collection," Zungu said. President Cyril Ramaphosa on Wednesday appointed Kieswetter for a term of five years with effect from May 1 on the recommendation of a selection panel appointed by the finance minister.

"We have a profound belief in respect for the environment and for promoting waste reduction. Each and every formulation, packaging, material, individual article or tool is designed to have a minimal environmental impact and to be long-lasting or reusable and composted or transformed into a new resource," Oway SA told Business Report. When asked if the organic market in SA is competitive and if it holds a future in the beauty industry, Oway explains that there is a great demand for organic products in SA. "South Africa is a country with a thriving beauty market, due to consumers becoming allergic to synthetic ingredients the demand is growing for organic products The pressures of a daily busy schedule is also why consumers are looking for an alternative relaxed organic type of lifestyle, Oway is not just a brand it is a lifestyle. Yes there is a future," said Oway SA. Oway SA noted that the products will all be made available with their pricing in May this year. WATCH:    BUSINESS REPORT ONLINE

Washington - President Donald Trump threatened on Friday to close the U.S. border with Mexico next week, or at least large sections of the frontier if Mexico "doesn't immediately stop all illegal immigration coming into the United States" from the region. Trump has repeatedly vowed to close the U.S. border with Mexico in the past. The latest threats came in a series of Twitter posts amid reports that a surge of migrants in El Paso, Texas, threatened to overwhelm border protection officials there. "CONGRESS MUST CHANGE OUR WEAK IMMIGRATION LAWS NOW, & Mexico must stop illegals from entering the U.S. through their country and our Southern Border," Trump said. "Mexico has for many years made a fortune off of the U.S., far greater than Border Costs. If Mexico doesnâ€™t immediately stop ALL illegal immigration coming into the United States through our Southern Border, I will be CLOSING the Border, or large sections of the Border, next week."

Berlin - One of Germany's richest families says it plans to give millions of euros to charity after learning about ancestors who enthusiastically supported the Nazis and used forced labour. Bild newspaper reported Sunday that documents revealed Albert Reimann Sr. and Albert Reimann Jr. used Russian civilians and French POWs as forced labourers. Family spokesman Peter Harf, who heads the Reimann's JAB Holding Company, says recent internal research confirmed Bild's findings. He says the family never spoke of the Nazi era but the evidence shows the father and son, who died in 1954 and 1984, "belonged in jail." Harf says the heirs plan to publish the research and donate 10 million euros ($11.3 million) to charity. JAB has controlling stakes in restaurant chain Pret a Manger, Krispy Kreme Doughnuts, Peet's Coffee and other businesses. AP

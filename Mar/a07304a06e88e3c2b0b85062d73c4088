Johannesburg - State-owned electricity company Eskom said on Tuesday the risk of being forced to implement rolling blackouts remained high although it had so far managed to avoid this due to some generating units returning to service. Eskom has struggled to meet demand and was forced to implement rotational blackouts, or loadshedding, in February to avoid a collapse of the grid under pressure. "Loadshedding will only be implemented if absolutely necessary," it said on Tuesday, urging residents and businesses to use electricity sparingly. * Receive IOL's top stories via WhatsApp by sending your name to 0745573535.

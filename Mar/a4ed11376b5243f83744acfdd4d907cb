ANC Women's League Young Women's Desk supported Simelane and accompanied her to the police station. Earlier on Monday, police confirmed that a docket of inquiry had been opened into the alleged assault by Babes' boyfriend Mandla "Mampintsha" Maphumulo. Police are currently investigating a video showing Maphumulo repeatedly hitting Simelane. Calls mounted for Maphumulo's arrest as the video, an Instagram live stream shared by Simelane, drew the ire of people around the country and the world. National police spokesperson Brigadier Vishnu Naidoo confirmed to IOL that an inquiry docket had been opened. Babes Wodumo's father has called on police to arrest Maphumulo. "She's stable but I'm not alright because I saw my daughter crying and Mandla is always beating my daughter. I told his father, Mr Maphumulo, to tell his son not to hit and kick and not to fight with my daughter but Mandla is keeping on hitting my daughter," said Simelane. "I will him to go to the police station and tell the world that he is an animal. He must be charged. I want to see Mampintsha behind bars."

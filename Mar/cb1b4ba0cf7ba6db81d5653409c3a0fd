 So #Mampintsha abuses #BabesWodumo, #DjTira condemns abuse #Mampinthsa releases a song with the same words from the abuse& #DjTira & his wife are jamming to it! How is any of this normal 🙆🏾‍♀️ pic.twitter.com/8TtAqw1LJP   Also I just wanna say that I'm so disgusted at DJ Tira the audacity of him to proudly promote Mampintsha's new single as if nobody knows what he did to Babes Wodumo on record.I can't even. pic.twitter.com/rl7msfGbj2   This entire #Mampintsha saga is exposing SA for who we truly are. We are happy to fight tooth&nail for a pig we witnessed beat up his gf 1/4 his body size. We celabrate perpetrators & support their endeavors and leave the victims of their abuse in a corner. #crymybelovedcountry   @TouchlineTruth Thank you for speaking about abuse pic.twitter.com/7m46HQPtLf #Mampintsha @slikouron   #Mampintsha Euphonik (sp) was accused of abuse but his shows still sell out. Kapa is there a criteria for who we mute? Do we only mute those with video footage because Bonang was crucified over this? I'm just asking

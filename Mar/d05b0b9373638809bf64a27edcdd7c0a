DURBAN - A man died in the surf at Leisure Bay near Port Edward on the KwaZulu-Natal South Coast, rescuers said on Friday. Alan Stilwell, NSRI Port Edward duty controller, said crew were dispatched at 8.55am on Friday following eye-witness reports of a drowning at Peter Pan Beach. He said the craft Rescue Runner was launched, lifeguards at the adjacent Kidds Beach responded, Police Search and Rescue, and Med-Evac and Netcare 911 ambulance services were activated. "It appears that a young woman was caught in rip currents while swimming, and her father went into the surf to assist followed by her mother." he said. "A local surfer and a young man swimming nearby went to their assistance after all three, the daughter, her mother and her father, were caught in rip currents. "The mother and the daughter were swept onto rocks where the surfer assisted them and they were brought to the beach by lifeguards and they were not injured. "Lifeguards recovered the father, a 40-year-old Johannesburg man, from the surf and paramedics conducted CPR efforts on the scene but sadly after all efforts to resuscitate the man were exhausted, he was declared dead," Stilwell said. Police opened an inquest docket and the body of the man was taken to Forensic Pathology Services.

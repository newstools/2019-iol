MUMBAI - Five people were killed and 36 injured when part of a pedestrian bridge collapsed during evening rush hour on Thursday in India's financial capital Mumbai, police said. At least three of the dead were women, Mumbai police spokesman Manjunath Singe said. The injured have been taken to hospital. An excavator was brought in to clear the debris that had blocked the movement of traffic on a busy road in south Mumbai. Fire engines and an ambulance were also at the site. The bridge connects to one of Mumbai's biggest local stations, Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus, which was the site of a militant attack in 2008, and is used by tens of thousands of commuters each day. Maharashtra state chief minister Devendra Fadnavis said on Twitter he was pained to hear about the accident and had asked municipal and police officials to ensure speedy relief efforts. The incident brought back memories of a rush hour stampede that killed at least 22 people and injured 36 in 2017 at a busy railway station in Mumbai.

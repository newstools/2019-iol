Athens - There were no immediate reports of damage or injuries after a 5.3 magnitude earthquake jolted central Greece on Saturday, authorities said. The tremor struck at 1046 GMT. Its epicentre was 8 kilometres south-west of the town of Galaxidi, according to the Athens Geodynamic Institute. The area has been shaken by quakes in the past. A Reuters witness felt the quake faintly in the capital Athens, 129 km to the west. The fire brigade reported no injuries. "Quite strong and long," one resident of the western city of Patras in the Peloponnese, 51 kilometres from the epicentre, wrote on the European-Mediterranean Seismological Centre website.

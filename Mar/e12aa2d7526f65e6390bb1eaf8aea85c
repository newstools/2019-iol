The Council members, who were nominated through BUSA and the Black Business Council (BBC), come from diverse sectors and will seek to optimise opportunities for South African business within BRICS. According to BUSA, the combination of the individuals in the Council bodes well. BUSA is pleased that this is a Council appointed by business, is made up of high-calibre individuals and is inclusive of senior businesswomen.

CAPE TOWN – SA Express on Thursday announced it would add another return flight between Johannesburg and Lubumbashi in the Democratic Republic of Congo as passenger demand has grown. "The introduction of this additional frequency is in response to high passenger demand on the route, and SA Express is most grateful for the overwhelming support that it is receiving on this destination," the airline's interim chief executive Siza Mzimela said. “Indeed, the airline continues to make major strides overall, and is firmly en route to achieving commercial sustainability as we accelerate the implementation of our new business strategies." "The airline operates a 70-seater regional jet CRJ 700 on the route, and passengers on the new SA Express service are, as usual, eligible to earn voyager miles," the airline's statement said.

In January Ford, posted a lower operating fourth-quarter profit as losses in every global region except North America weighed on results. In a January 24 e-mail to employees after posting those results, Hackett told employees the company would not accept last year’s “mediocre” results and said Ford was aiming to nearly double its annual operating profit. He provided no time frame for hitting that target. Hackett, told employees in that email “time to bury (2018) ... in a deep grave.”

Jenner, 21, the half-sister of reality television stars Kim, Khloé and Kourtney Kardashian, made it onto the annual Forbes list of billionaires after debuting her Kylie Cosmetics online in 2015 with $29 (R411) lip kits containing matching lipstick and lip liner. Forbes said she was the world’s youngest billionaire and also the youngest self-made billionaire ever. On their billionaires list, Forbes distinguishes between those who inherited much of their wealth and those who made their fortunes on their own. Jenner would be in 2057th place whether she was self-made or inherited. Last year, Kylie Cosmetics did an estimated $360million in sales, according to Forbes. Jenner, who has a 1-year-old daughter, owns 100% of the company. She also makes money from endorsements and appearances on cable TV’s Keeping Up with the Kardashians. - REUTERS

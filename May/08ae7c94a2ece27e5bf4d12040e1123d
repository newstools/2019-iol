"The record number of Afghans seeking rehabilitation assistance is a reflection of the huge levels of need," said Alberto Cairo, the ICRC's physical rehabilitation programme manager in Afghanistan. The ICRC ceased most of its activities in Afghanistan following the withdrawal of protective guarantees by the Taliban on April 11. According to an annual report by the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA), children accounted for 28 per cent of civilian casualties in armed conflict in 2018. The agency recorded 3,062 child casualties (927 deaths and 2,135 injured), with non-suicide IED (improvised explosive device) attacks listed as the second most common cause.

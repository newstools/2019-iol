Johannesburg - Gauteng Premier David Makhura has moved MEC Lesufi Panyazi from the Finance and e-Government portfolio back to Education. Makhura, in statement said, he made this decision after receiving a lot of feedback on the composition of his new Executive Council. "While there is an appreciation of the appointment of MEC Panyaza Lesufi to the Finance and e-Government portfolio, the overall non-partisan feedback from society, the education sector and the movement in general is that it will serve Gauteng better that he remains in the Education portfolio to continue the good work of ensuring that our province is the leader and pioneer of educational transformation." "I have now decided that MEC Panyaza Lesufi will return to the Education portfolio as the MEC for Education and Youth Development and that MEC Nomantu Nkomo-Ralehoko will be the MEC for Finance and e-Government." He add that his team of ten MECs has a diverse set of skills, vast experience and talents that enable them to play different roles in several portfolios.

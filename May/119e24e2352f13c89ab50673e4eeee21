JOHANNESBURG - The rand shrugged off risk-off sentiment in global markets as the local unit opened on a firmer footing yesterday morning according to NKC Research. The South African currency whipsawed throughout the session and ran out of momentum in late trade. Rooted in uncertainty regarding US-Sino trade talks, risk assets headed lower again yesterday (we do not foresee an imminent long-lasting comprehensive trade agreement), although the rand bucked the trend in optimism for an uneventful conclusion of the May 8 national poll, with nearly two-thirds of voting districts pointing to a comfortable ANC victory. At the close of local trade, the rand quoted 0.3 percent weaker at R14.42/$, after trading in range of R14.31/$ - R14.47/$. The rand traded firmer overnight. Expected range today R14.25/$ - R14.40/$.

In the overall emerging market sphere, the MSCI Emerging Market Index (-2.1 percent) traded lower. In local news, Steinhoff’s (-20.4 percent) share price tumbled yesterday after the embattled firm reported a $4bn operating loss for 2017 fiscal year.

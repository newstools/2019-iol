The fair is a highlight on the cityâ€™s business calendar and provides a boost for local businesses that not only get to showcase their products and services but also get to network with possible investors and clients. Businesses that have an interest in exhibiting their products at the main Durban Business Fair at the Inkosi Albert Luthuli ICC and the Durban Exhibition Centre, between September 22 to 29, have until May 31 to register. eThekwini municipality said several influential business role-players have been lined up to share their expertise. Investors will also have a chance to tap into up-and-coming businesses.

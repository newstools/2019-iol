Born-free - noun a member of a generation born in a country after its transition to democracy, in particular, post-apartheid South Africa - Oxford Dictionary. South Africa will hold its sixth national and provincial elections on May 8. As part of our #Elections2019 coverage, IOL has asked 94 Born Frees for their views on the upcoming elections. Will they be voting? Who influences who they vote for, if anybody? What issue would most affect their decision on who to vote for? While never having endured the brutality of apartheid, the Born Frees face their own struggles, including high unemployment, access to education and issues around identity. Watch as we speak to 18-year-old Kenan Manickum. Kenan has not registered to vote in this election, but he says one of the things that would make him go to the polls would be education. "As a student I am interested in free education," said Kenan. #BornFree #MzansiVotes #My94

Born-free - noun a member of a generation born in a country after its transition to democracy, in particular, post-apartheid South Africa - Oxford Dictionary. South Africa will hold its sixth national and provincial elections on May 8. As part of our #Elections2019 coverage, IOL has asked 94 Born Frees for their views on the upcoming elections. Will they be voting? Who influences who they vote for, if anybody? What issue would most affect their decision on who to vote for? While never having endured the brutality of apartheid, the Born Frees face their own struggles, including high unemployment, access to education and issues around identity. Watch as we speak to 18-year-old first-time voter Traci Hurling who says she made an effort to educate herself about the elections. "I think the biggest challenge that born frees face is finding solutions for the long-term consequences of apartheid such as the obvious socio-economic disparities between the different races. It's our generation's responsibility to uplift and build the country but it's becoming increasingly difficult with all the corruption, racism and sexism in the country," said Traci. #BornFree #MzansiVotes #My94

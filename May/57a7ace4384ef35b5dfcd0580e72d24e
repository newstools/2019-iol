Allocation of hunting blocks by government officials to tourist companies has been dogged by allegations of impropriety and loss of revenues. But in a new initiative, the state-run Tanzania Wildlife Management Authority will next month auction 26 hunting blocks for the first time. â€œAuctioning will commence on June 10, 2019 and will last for seven consecutive days." Tourism is the main source of hard currency in Tanzania, best know for beaches, wildlife and Mt Kilimanjaro. Revenues from the sector fetched $2.43billion (about R34.7bn) last year, up from $2.19bn in 2017, according to official data. Tourist arrivals totalled 1.49million last year, compared with 1.33million a year ago. President John Magufuli's government said it wants to bring in the country 2million visitors a year by 2020. - Reuters African News Agency (ANA)

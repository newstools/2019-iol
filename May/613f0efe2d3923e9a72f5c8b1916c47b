South Africa will hold its sixth national and provincial elections on May 8. As part of our #Elections2019 coverage, IOL has asked 94 Born Frees for their views on the upcoming elections. Will they be voting? Who influences who they vote for, if anybody? What issue would most affect their decision on who to vote for? While never having endured the brutality of apartheid, the Born Frees face their own struggles, including high unemployment, access to education and issues around identity. Watch as we speak to Johannesburg student Lebogang who is concerned with lack of infrastructure development, education and services. "The party that I vote for ... what I'd like them to change is infrastructure, education, safety, transport .... those kinds of basic stuff " Lebogang said. #BornFree #MzansiVotes #My94

Among those aged 65 to 74 in the UK, 83% regularly go online, up from 53% in 2011 and the largest increase in recent internet use of any age group. And for those aged 75 and over, using the internet has also drastically increased, rising from 20% in 2011 to almost 47% now. A report from the Office for National Statistics showed that almost everybody in Britain under pension age is a regular internet user. It said more than 99% of those under 45 were routinely online, with internet use rates now higher in the UK than in Germany, France, the Netherlands or Sweden. The report said: “In 2019, within the UK, 91% of all adults had recently used the internet, with almost all adults aged 16 to 44, or 99%, being recent internet users.” It added that the share of those over 65 who have never used the internet had fallen since 2011 to below a third. Among those aged 45 to 54, over 97% were regular internet users, and more than 93% of those between 55 and 65 were regularly online. Among working-age people, men and women were equally familiar with internet use. Nearly four in five dis- abled people were users. DAILY MAIL

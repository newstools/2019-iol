JOHANNESBURG - The rand slumped to a 5-month low during the early European session, dragged down by domestic political concerns and risk-off sentiment as US-Sino trade talk progress deteriorated according to NKC Research. Negative momentum was dragged into early European trade as Tuesday’s swearing in of deputy president David Mabuza cast a cloud of concern over whether the ruling ANC will be able to deliver on promises of clean governance as the deadline for the appointment of Cabinet was fast approaching. Meanwhile, US-Sino trade tensions escalated, feeding into risk-off sentiment. At the close of local trade, the rand quoted 2.7 percent weaker at R14.76/$, after trading in range of R14.71/$ - R14.78/$. The rand clawed back losses overnight.

JOHANNESBURG - The rand racked up gains late in the European session on hopes that China might implement more stimulus measures to keep the economy from slowing further according to NKC Research.

Retail sales, an indicator of domestic demand, rose by a meagre 0.2 percent y-o-y and slipped by 0.7 percent m-o-m. At the close of local trade, the rand quoted 0.3 percent stronger at R14.20/$, after trading in range of R14.18/$ - R14.30/$. The rand ticked lower overnight.

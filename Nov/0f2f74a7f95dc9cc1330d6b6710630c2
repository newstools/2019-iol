Cape Town - The Directors of the National Heritage Project Non-Profit Company will launch the Long March to Freedom exhibition at Century City in Cape Town on Thursday. The Long March to Freedom is a monumental procession of 100 life-size bronze statues and is the largest exhibition of its kind anywhere in the world. "I think it is very important that the project Long march to freedom is not just about the Mandela generation and my generation. Its about our history from the time of the original people. These are real people who have been struggling for a long time and as we used to say 'Aluta continua' . The struggle continues now and this exhibition tells us why we must continue until we have reached equality for all our people," said Struggle icon Dennis Goldberg.

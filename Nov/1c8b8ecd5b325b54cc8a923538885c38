Cape Town – Sekunjalo Independent Media (SIM) on Tuesday received an application for its liquidation from the Public Investment Corporation (PIC). The application cites SIM and its executive chairperson, Dr Iqbal Survé, as respondents. SIM spokesperson Takudzwa Hove told Business Report that among the many errors in the supporting affidavit the PIC and its advisors cited the incorrect parties to the relevant legal agreements. "This action is not only incompetent and mala fide (in bad faith), but malicious, on the part of the PIC and its advisors. "SIM is of the firm belief that this action is designed as a further attempt to embarrass and undermine the Sekunjalo Group, and Dr Survé personally, and is aimed at provoking a run on SIM’s major subsidiary, Independent Media, which is fully operational. "This is part of a series of coordinated attacks on Independent Media, and ultimately, an attack on media freedom," said Hove. He said the PIC and its advisors had elected not to disclose in their court papers a letter dated September 30 from SIM's attorneys to the PIC's attorneys wherein it lays out why SIM is not indebted to the PIC for any sum. "SIM has to date not received any response from the PIC in this regard. "This application is a waste of taxpayers’ money and constitutes irregular spending on the part of the PIC, which should be investigated by the appropriate authorities," said Hove. SIM has instructed its attorneys to oppose this "frivolous" application and seek the appropriate relief against those involved, which will include seeking a special costs order against the PIC and holding those responsible personally liable, he said. * This is a developing story.

 Hi there. Thanks for reaching out to us. At times products that are on the Blue Dot Sale were previously discounted in our daily deals or another sale so they were already sold at a lower price.   Hi there. Thanks for reaching out to us. At times products that are on the Blue Dot Sale were previously discounted in our daily deals or another sale so they were already sold at a lower price.   ðŸ˜‚ ðŸ˜‚, that's a big lie, i bought these twice already from you guys at a price lower than R2500. But jah we understand   I thought I was the only one who noticed this scam of the century. Been looking to buy and external hard drive for months but itâ€™s the same price as last month and the month before. @TAKEALOT is playing games here.   Then that means what these companies are doing is unlawful ðŸ¥º false advertising   My dog food was R599 on takealot then they pushed it up to R629 and then R700 now it's on a Black Friday special at R599 again ðŸ™ƒ   @TAKEALOT What joke is this, I had these in my cart for months at the same price of R2512, all of the sudden the original price is R6028 ðŸ˜‚ ðŸ˜‚ ðŸ˜‚ ðŸ˜‚, had so much respect for this site, day light fraud#Takealot#BlackFridayMe pic.twitter.com/m9aFj0WTlN   lmao @TAKEALOT prices went UP on Black Friday ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ the two laptops I was looking at were 9754 and 11999 and are now 10249 and 13127 ðŸ˜† you sneaky little bullshitters you !!! So much respect lost, wow.   Could you explain how and/or why the price increased by more than R500 in the space of 3 days? Is this normal?   #Takealot lol I'm ALWAYS shopping on Takealot and the items I'm seeing that are now apparently marked down for black Fridays their "Blue dot sale" are the very same items that have been marked down for months ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ I love Takealot but now they taking us for a ride.

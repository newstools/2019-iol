Makhanda - African Medallion Group (AMG) says it has received information alleging that agents of Zimbabwe's first family members have attempted to interfere in the judicial process in the personal custody matter of its founder, Frank Buyanga Sadiqi, for personal and political motives. AMG said recently one of Sadiqi's legal representatives was abducted and although the matter was reported to the police, there had not yet been an investigation. "These tactics to attack our founder by using his innocent five-year-old child and the mother to further their cause are in our view nothing less than cheap and inhumane," the company said in a statement. Calling for the arrests of those involved, AMG warned in a statement that if anything happened to Sadiqi, it would hold members of the first family and all their agents fully accountable and responsible. "If these shenanigans continue, African Medallion Group will release evidence whereby these agents have been instructed to create false information regarding our founder to interfere with his credibility as well as the custody matter. "Such evidence will reveal the shenanigans that these agents and the first family is involved in to further their political influences." However, the AMG said that despite these allegations, it was convinced that the judiciary had remained independent and commended it for this. African News Agency (ANA)

 Chaotic maan uFaf 😂 pic.twitter.com/nZPwtDQ1Ss  Me when my friends ask me to take a pic of them: https://t.co/56Veol1jLN   I'm all the way here for Faf's chaotic energy 🤣 https://t.co/VPK4V2bt7j   Taking Faf's chaotic energy with me into 2020. 💃🏾   “The only De Klerk we FW” https://t.co/XJAJdqR0Hc   Faf de Klerk = chaotic good.   Channelling that chaotic Faf de Klerk energy I see   I want to live my life with the same chaotic energy as @fafdeklerk #RWC2019Champions   Faf De Klerk has the energy of a toddler. Chaotic. Messy. All over the place. Highly entertaining. 😂   Faf is oulik and chaotic I just wanna keep in my pocket. Faf in my pocket! Cute as can be. I wish I could take you home with me AND NOW YOU CAN! 😂   Faf De Klerk appreciation post 🇿🇦. Loved watching him on the field. A whole mood. #SpringbokChampions #Springboks #fafdeklerk pic.twitter.com/aKibDz4Mhx   Faf is so freaking cool 😎😎 it's not even funny anymore 😒 #ChampionsTogether  Now here's a bit of irresistible cuteness. This young man has obviously found a hero in Francois 'Faf' de Klerk, and knows his every move.I thought it would add to the appeal to edit some real Faf footage into his backyard test match, during which he won the world cup. pic.twitter.com/Yp1egDaD8w  Faf de Klerk is my muse this festive season. Everything I do, everything I say & every drink I consume. Faf!   I wanna be his friend. Where do I apply #fafdeklerk https://t.co/8gtf1Fh2CI   But Faf De Klerk is a whole mood ey😅🔥🔥🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾 pic.twitter.com/qiplNAzcIj  Anyone feel like being a darling and driving me to East London this Saturday?

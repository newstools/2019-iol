Cape Town - The Democratic Alliance welcomed the raid by the Special Investigative Unit (SIU) on the offices of the Lepelle Northern Water Board in Polokwane on Monday morning. The raid centres around alleged corruption in the multi-billion rand water infrastructure project in Giyani, in Limpopo province. The main opposition SA said allegations of corruption had plagued the project since inception, leaving some 50 villages around Giyani with no potable water. "Currently residents have to walk for up to five kilometres to carry contaminated water back to their houses," DA member of parliament Jacques Smalle said. He said he believed the project was just one example of wide-spread corruption that has incapacitated government departments in Limpopo. "Investigations that lead to arrests are only positive if they lead to successful prosecution and the DA now calls for priority prosecution of government corruption. The people of this province have had enough of grand-scale corruption by the ANC government and it is time they are brought to book," Smalle said. The Lepelle water board is tasked with building, running and maintaining regional bulk infrastructure. The Giyani project stalled after the department of water allegedly failed to pay the contractor.

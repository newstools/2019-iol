Johannesburg - AmaXhosa King Mpendulo Calvin Zwelonke Sigcawu has died at the age of 51. It has been reported that the king was rushed to hospital earlier this week due to poor health. Funeral arrangements are expected to be released by the family later this week. Mpendulo Zwelonke Sigcawu was the King of the Xhosa people. He took on that role on 1 January 2006. He was the son of Xolilizwe Mzikayise Sigcawu and Nozamile. Eastern Cape Premier Oscar Mabuyane is expected to visit the royal family.Â Mabuyane told media that Sigcawu assisted the government to transform the province. "He was not just a king for himself, he was a king for his people who was always out there articulating the interests of his people. As a government we've lost a serious social partner in him, a man with a very solid contribution on how we're shaping the province." Sigcawu was the 22nd AmaXhosa monarch.

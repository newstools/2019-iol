The kingmakers - more like troublemakers and king-wannabes considering what’s been happening in the Joburg and Tshwane councils - will converge at that same place of shocks, the place where, shuddering, Jacob Zuma’s world ended and his post-apocalyptic wasteland nightmare began. Things just got worse yesterday with the court ruling. EFF leader Julius Malema himself said all the top positions were open to contestation at their December 13 to 6 congress. His position seems secure while most of those around him look like gonners, including party chairperson Dali Mpofu. But former DA leader Mmusi Maimane also seemed securely ensconced on his perch only six months ago. Are we in for another coup, more spectacular friendly fire and fireworks in another opposition party before the year is over? Or another big-fish arrest like that of former minister Bongani Bongo? Or more bombshells before Judge Raymond Zondo and elsewhere? You might not be invested in the EFF and its fortunes, but remember the radicals want to be real kingmakers - and later kings - when they grow up. And they occupy a strategically important space in our democracy. December will not bore us. Watch this space. * Mazwi Xaba is the editor of the Independent On Saturday

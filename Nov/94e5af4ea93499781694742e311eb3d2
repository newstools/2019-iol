Pic: Supplied The Protea Hotel by Marriott Cape Town Victoria Junction has opened its doors to the local business community with an invitation to use the hotel’s public spaces as a co-working space where creativity, business ventures and networking can intersect. Co-working spaces are a rising trend worldwide, and with its prime location minutes from the V&A Waterfront, Cape Town’s CDB, and the Cape Quarter; the hotel is perfectly placed to offer local freelancers, start-ups and business owners a modern and professional space to conduct their business with style, flexibility and convenience. “Both guests and locals are welcome to use our public spaces on a complimentary basis to host their meetings, just catch up on their emails or enjoy a great cup of coffee while they plan their next business venture. And why not celebrate closing a successful deal with one of our beers on tap for only R25, or any other choice from our wide range of alcoholic or non-alcoholic beverages and cocktails in our modern, contemporary-chic setting?” explains Danny Bryer, Area Director, Sales and Marketing, Protea Hotels by Marriott, Marriott International, Middle East and Africa. “We hope to see you soon and look forward to supporting the local business community as we foster a culture of entrepreneurship and job creation in our new co-working spaces.” GET DIRECTIONS  VIEW OFFERS  CONTACT US  +27 21 418 1234

Johannesburg - The ANC in Gauteng has welcomed the appointment of former Gauteng MEC for Economic Development Dr Kgosientso Ramokgopa as head of the Investment and Infrastructure Office in the Presidency. On Monday evening, the Presidency announced Ramakgopa's appointment as head of the office, which will be responsible for developing the country’s investment strategy, refining the institutional infrastructure for investment mobilisation, and establishing an investment intelligence capability. "The Investment and Infrastructure Office will also enable the Presidency to oversee coordination between all structures dealing with infrastructure development, including the Infrastructure Fund, which is being incubated at the Development Bank of Southern Africa. "This will allow the Presidency to monitor progress and address blockages in priority infrastructure projects and the private sector projects identified through the Investment Conference," the Presidency said in a statement. The Presidency also announced the appointment of Jeff Radebe, Derek Hanekom and Elizabeth Thabethe as additional Special Envoys on Investment focusing on specific areas. Gauteng ANC in a statement congratulated Ramokgopa on his appointment, with the PEC expressing "its full confidence in Ramokgopa’s abilities, credentials and commitment to helping grow South Africa". "We have no doubt that Dr Ramokgopa will assume this new responsibility with the same energy and commitment he has always undertaken tasks assigned to him." Ramokgopa last month resigned as Economic Development MEC to make way for the appointment of a female MEC in line with ANC policy, which states that in provinces, where the premier is male, 60% of the MECs must be female.

It gave us queer representation in a meaningful way and really helped start conversations in our households.From Steve's gay wedding to the infamous threesome with Len, Nandipha and Johnny it did the things. pic.twitter.com/mGtiSdurdS     Makes the 2 of us.I am really hurt and sad. #Isidingo     What is happening to Isidingo is a reflection of what is happening to SABC as a Broadcaster, if u don't invest in good content definitely u gonna bleed viewers.     First Top Billing and now Isidingo üíî SABC will never be the same     #IsidingoIsidingo is one of those few soapies that have good acting production and story line although they slip sometimes plot wise     Let's not forget these queens üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠ #Isidingo pic.twitter.com/oXxMCAzn8t     In all honesty, Isidingo can go. It fell off a very long time ago,     Further, it is the ONLY SOAPIE in SA that can have a scene in it that covers something that happened in real life within South Africa (24 hrs turn around time).It's a those small scenes that make me appreciate the show that much more.#Isidingo     I still believe Isidingo would do better on another channel. Maybe I‚Äôm wrong - but they could have tested that first. Their story line is way apart and better than some of SABC 1‚Äôs most watched show. https://t.co/7FwSPGKnMR

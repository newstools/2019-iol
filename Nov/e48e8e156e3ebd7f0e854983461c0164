On 20 October 2019, CEO of ITHUBA Charmaine Mabuza scooped the Top Woman in Education Award at the Vision 2030 Awards organised by Topco Media. This award recognizes Mabuza for her contribution in the South African education sector through the Eric and Charmaine Mabuza Scholarship Foundation. The Foundation, established in 1999 by business veterans, Advocate Eric and Charmaine Mabuza initially supported young and talented matriculants in the Mpumalanga region to further their tertiary studies. Since then, the Foundation’s reach has expanded throughout South Africa, producing Doctors, Accountants, Engineers, Quantity Surveyors and many more. Commenting on the award, Mabuza said: “This award represents many years of hard work and determination towards the advancement of equal access to quality education for all South Africans. The mission of the scholarship foundation is to eradicate poverty through education, particularly in previously marginalized communities. As a corporate leader, we know that there is still a lot to be done, but we are ready and willing to do our part. We look forward to another decade of serving the nation”. One of the beneficiaries of the Scholarship Foundation, Dr. Kate Lusiki who now works at the Rob Ferreira Hospital expressed her gratitude: “Since I started working, I have been able to renovate my mother’s house. I am currently staying with my older sister whom I am putting through college so that she can also have a solid educational structure. I am able to do these things for my family because Advocate and Mrs Mabuza afforded me an opportunity to education. This Foundation to me, has been like a better life handed to me on a silver platter, and for that I am grateful.” The 2020 Scholarship programme will launch with the new intake on 12 January. The Topco Vision30 Awards took place at Emperors Palace, Johannesburg on Wednesday night.

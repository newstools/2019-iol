Johannesburg – Sudan’s Forces of Freedom and Change, the coalition movement behind the massive protests which engulfed the North African country eventually leading to the ousting of former president Omar al-Bashir, has stated that it has no qualms about handing him over to the International Criminal Court (ICC) to be tried for genocide. “We have no objection to handing over Bashir to the ICC,” Ibrahim Al Sheikh, a leader of the umbrella protest movement, told reporters late on Sunday. “All the members of the Forces of Freedom and Change agree on that.” Bashir, who was forced out of office in April, has been wanted by the ICC for years for war crimes and crimes against humanity allegedly committed in Sudan’s Darfur region. The ICC’s demand, which was renewed in April, has been supported by rights groups internationally as well as Sudan’s opposition factions and political activists, Al Araby reported.

However, the military generals who initially seized power in the wake of Bashir’s fall from power, had refused to hand him over to the ICC. Since August Sudan has been ruled by a joint civilian-military sovereign council which includes leaders from the umbrella protest movement. The ICC’s Rome Statute would need to be ratified by the transitional authorities before the former president, who is now being held in prison in Khartoum facing corruption charges, could be transferred to the ICC. According to the UN approximately 300,000 people have been killed and 2.5 million displaced in Sudan’s years of conflict. African News Agency (ANA)

Kenya’s Health Ministry will start introducing free cervical cancer vaccines, targeting 10-year-old girls, from Friday. The government has set aside $8 million for the project which aims to immunise 800 000 girls against the cancer-causing papilloma virus (HPV). Two doses of the HPV vaccine will be given to the girls six months apart, at about 9 000 public, private and faith-based facilities countrywide, the East African reported. “Starting this Friday we will start the routine roll-out of the cervical cancer vaccine and the country is ready with 1.3 million doses for the current year against the 800 000 target. We will give out two doses for maximum protection,” said Health Cabinet Secretary, Cecily Kariuki. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that

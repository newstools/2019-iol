When the City was approached for comment, the angle of the story was that the social media pressure group Stop COCT had approached the public protector to investigate the City’s electricity tariffs. Early in the day, the City responded as follows: “Importantly, the City has acted within the law, in openness and in the best interest of the diverse Cape Town population. Its increase is 8.88% v Eskom’s increase of 15.6%, and the City’s increase is also much lower than in many other metros. “The surcharge is 10% - that goes to shared services and costs. Sixty-five percent of the tariff cost goes to buying power from Eskom and 25% to operating the grid. No profit is made. Income is not profit. The City has nothing to hide and welcomes any workable counter-proposals, of which there have never been any submitted, despite a considerable effort made with the group or on the issues raised by this social media pressure group.” * Phindile Maxiti is mayoral committee member for energy and climate change. ** The views expressed here are not necessarily those of Independent Newspapers.

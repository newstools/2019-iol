Phnom Penh, Cambodia - A police officer in Cambodia says 150 people are searching for a young British woman who is missing on an island popular with travelers. Maj. Gen. Chuon Narin, chief for coastal Preah Sihanouk province, says divers, policemen, navy personnel, local volunteers and foreigners are taking part in the search for 21-year-old Amelia Bambridge. She has not been seen since last Wednesday night when she went to a beach party on Koh Rong island in southwestern Cambodia. Chuon Narin expressed guarded optimism that Bambridge might be found alive, telling The Associated Press that several foreign tourists have previously gone missing but were found safe after being lost in a jungle area. Bambridge's brother Harry arrived in Cambodia on Sunday to help in the search for his sister. AP

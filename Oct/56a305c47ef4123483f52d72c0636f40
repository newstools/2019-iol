CAPE TOWN â€“ Since Sunday evening, Fortnite has been trending on social media afterÂ fans spiraled into a panic when the game 'disappeared' and turned into a black hole. According to multiple reports, It seems as if the reason for this black hole is that Forniteâ€˜s 10th season has come to an end. Players were getting ready to participate in a live event and as it took off, they were sucked into what appeared to be a black hole at the centre of the map. Since then, the game just keeps showing the black hole. The game's Twitter page has been replaced by the black hole and its website shows the same outcome.     . https://t.co/cTqXvOTuoa Meanwhile,Â  fans have taken to Twitter to comment on the gameâ€™s disappearance.

In September 2019,Â The Fortnite Champion Series (FNCS) Finals got off to a stuttering start. The top trios in Europe began Fortnite action for the day. However, matchmaking problems halted the first heat after two matches. Epic Games rescheduled the rest of Heat 1 for Saturday afternoon. The same issue delayed the Brazil, North America East and North America West regions by one hour on Friday. Additionally, the North America East region played five games before more issues caused the sixth and final game to be rescheduled for Saturday evening. Players were notably frustrated with the delays. BUSINESS REPORT ONLINE, REUTERS

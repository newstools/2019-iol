Bogota - The death toll in Chile's violent protests has risen to 18, the government said on Wednesday. Interior Ministry official Rodrigo Ubilla said three people had been killed during the past 24 hours. Two of them, an adult and a 4-year-old child, were hit by a vehicle. The third victim was allegedly beaten by police officers in an incident which was being investigated, broadcaster 24 Horas quoted Ubilla as saying. The government had earlier given a death toll of 15, including 11 people who died in fires at business establishments in the Santiago metropolitan region. Chile was seen as one of South America's stablest democracies, but it was then hit by a nationwide protest wave against inequality that was sparked by metro fare hikes. President Sebastian Pinera cancelled the fare hikes and on Tuesday announced a reform package, including increases in pensions and the minimum salary. Protests nevertheless continued in several cities, with police using water canon to disperse demonstrators in Santiago, according to 24 Horas. Pope Francis launched an appeal for peace, saying dialogue should be used "to find solutions to the crisis and to deal with the difficulties that have generated it."

DURBAN – The rand closed marginally weaker than the last session against the dollar after the domestic session opened with the rand trading in the low 14.60s. Nedbank CIB research analyst Reezwana Sumad said Wednesday’s improved levels in the rand proved attractive to greenback buyers and saw the rand weaken to R14.71 on the day before recovering lost ground hovering around the low R14.60s to the dollar later in the day. At 5pm the domestic currency was bid 4c weaker than the same time bid on Wednesday at R14.68 against the dollar. Against the pound it was 3c stronger at R18.83 and bid at R16.30 to the euro. Sumad said the international markets were again subdued. “The pound was also range-bound versus the dollar, but this morning, it managed recover lost ground. Gold has held steady over the most recent sessions,” said Sumad. She said the technical formation for an attempt on R14.40 a dollar remained intact. Treasury partner at Peregrine Treasury Solutions Bianca Botes said the rand traded in a tight range on Wednesday, struggling to break below R14.60/$ after testing it a few times in late afternoon trade. “Market focus is starting to shift to the Fed interest rate decision later this month, while upbeat sentiment is surrounding the US-China trade deal that will potentially be signed at the G20 summit next month,” said Botes She said weak data from the US would have seen the rand gain additional momentum, potentially breaking below the R14.60 mark.

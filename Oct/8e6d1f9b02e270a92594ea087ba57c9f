Recently, the sports car maker announced a new entry-level model called the 4S. The 4S is less powerful than the aforementioned range-toppers, but still impressively potent, and buyers can choose between two battery options. The one fitted with the standard Performance Battery is good for 390kW while those opting for the Performance Battery Plus will have 420kW to play with. For the record, the Turbo and Turbo S versions produce 500kW and 560kW respectively.

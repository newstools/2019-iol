Port Elizabeth - Eastern Cape police on Friday said it was investigating a case of house robbery after an elderly woman was robbed at gunpoint at a frail care centre in Port Elizabeth minutes after the lights went out during rotational power cuts. Police spokeswoman, Captain Sandra Janse Van Rensburg said the 76-year-old, who resides at the frail care home in Lakeside Road in Chelsea, opened the door to let the dog outside on Thursday evening. Janse Van Rensburg said the woman was then confronted by four suspects armed with a iron bar and a firearm. The suspects forced the woman back into the house, she said. The suspects demanded money and went to three other rooms in the facility and took cash and two cellphones. Janse Van Rensburg said the suspects fled of foot and no one was injured during the robbery. Police urged residents, especially those residing at frail care centres, to be vigilant at night during loadshedding. “Always be prepared and know the scheduled times. Keep doors and windows closed and don’t answer to anyone you are not expecting. Try to complete chores and errands prior to the lights going out,” said Janse Van Rensburg. African News Agency/ANA

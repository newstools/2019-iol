Cape Town – An awaiting-trial prisoner's escape plan backfired spectacularly – he broke his legs jumping off the roof of a police station and has had a case of escaping from lawful custody added to his woes. However, the 34-year-old almost had police fooled after he had managed to convince an officer he had been injured by a speeding car nearby after he was found crawling outside the Thohoyandou police cells in Limpopo, TimesLive reported. A day later in hospital, though, he was recognised as an escapee and arrested on Wednesday. According to police, the man had been in custody on charges for murder, business robbery, robbery in transit, malicious damage to property and possession of an unlicensed firearm. "He apparently broke his legs when he jumped from the rooftop of the cells and crashed on the ground," said Limpopo police spokesperson Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo. "He then deceived the police member who found him in the station yard that he was knocked down by a speeding vehicle on the adjacent road and that the vehicle failed to stop after the accident. "He was then taken to hospital for medical attention, only to be recognised by the other member, who was performing guard duties at the same hospital as the prisoner who escaped the previous day. "He was immediately rearrested and is currently under police guard at the hospital."

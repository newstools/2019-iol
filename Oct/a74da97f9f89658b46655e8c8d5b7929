Sudan and South Sudan have made significant progress towards resolving their border dispute following talks in the Sudanese capital Khartoum with only five areas now subject to further negotiations. Following agreement between the two sides on border lines and the financial cost of the border demarcation programme during the 11th Joint Border Commission talks, witnessed by the African Union office in Sudan, new maps and frontier marks are to be drawn, the East African reported. However, five areas are still under contention including the Dabba Al Fukhar, Jabal Al Muqainis and Kaka areas on the border as well as Kefi Kenji and the Hofrat Al Nehass commercial areas in South Darfur, a 13-square-kilometre region inhabited by tribes from Darfur in western Sudan.

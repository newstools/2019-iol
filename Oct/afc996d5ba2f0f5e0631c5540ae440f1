Johannesburg - Johannesburg residents will soon have relief as the M2 freeway will be reopened and fully operational for motorists November 4. The official opening ceremony took place on Thursday and was attended by outgoing Joburg Mayor Herman Mashaba, leader of the Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) Mangosuthu Buthelezi and Gauteng Premier David Makhura. Speaking at the ribbon-cutting ceremony, Mashaba said he was proud of the work of the leadership that ensured that the project materialised to the optimum level. “I am so proud of the leadership that delivered this project on time. For the next 50 years, this road is here for our residents to use. Monday, 6 'o clock this road will be ready for our residents to use,” he said. He added that the reconstruction and closing of the road was not an easy one but was vital to ensure the longevity of the route for future generations to come. This freeway is not just here to serve people of Johannesburg. This job that I am doing is one of the most rewarding jobs. The past three years have been really fruitful,” said Mashaba. Makhura said the closure of the bridge was very stressful as it limited the economy. “This an infrastructure story and the work that was done here is very important because when you have good infrastructure you are able to connect your people and the M2 is a very important connector,” he said.

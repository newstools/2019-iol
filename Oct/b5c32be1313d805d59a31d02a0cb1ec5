Kiev - Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Thursday that US President Donald Trump did not seek to blackmail him during a phone call in July or a meeting in September. Zelenskiy said he had not known that US military aid to Ukraine had been blocked at the time of the call. Having been made aware of this by his defence minister later, he raised the issue during a separate meeting in September in Poland with Vice President Mike Pence. The US House of Representatives has launched an impeachment inquiry against Trump, focused on whether he used congressionally approved aid to Ukraine as leverage to pressure Zelenskiy to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, one of Trump's main Democratic rivals as he seeks re-election in 2020. Trump has made allegations, without evidence, that Biden engaged in improper dealings in Ukraine. Biden's son Hunter was on the board of Ukrainian gas company Burisma. Zelenskiy told reporters that his aim in having a phone call with Trump was to arrange a subsequent meeting and that he had asked the White House to change its rhetoric on Ukraine. "There was no blackmail. This was not the subject of our conversation," Zelenskiy said. Zelenskiy said there were no conditions attached to him meeting Trump, including whether he should investigate the activities of Hunter at Burisma. The White House published its summary of the call between Zelenskiy and Trump in September. Asked whether the Ukrainian version matched up to the US one, Zelenskiy said: "I didn't even check, but I think that it matches completely."

Stats SA said power distribution or consumption was down 4.7 percent on a year-on-year basis in August and retreated 2.2 percent month-on-month. The country gets 95 percent of its electricity from state-owned utility Eskom, which struggled to meet demand earlier this year, leading to planned rolling blackouts to avoid a total collapse of the national grid.  - African News Agency (ANA)

Even though he grew up in a village in the Drakensberg in KwaZulu-Natal. Sbhekile Ndlangisa knew from an early age that he didnâ€™t want to follow the usual career path of being a teacher, nurse or policeman. The Durban-based jewellery designer and manufacturer made a name for himself in the industry with his handmade three-dimensional designs, which were a break-away from the traditional flat and stationary jewellery. Schooled in jewellery design and manufacture at the Durban University of Technology (DUT), Ndlangisa began honing his real-world metal-working skills as a first year student in 2006.

Ndlangisa has clinched a number of industry awards, such as the Sanlam private investment innovation in jewellery design award in 2009 and in 2014 he was highlighted as an emerging creative designer by the Design Indaba.

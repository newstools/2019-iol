About 90 percent of cars in Nigeria were smuggled into the country by unscrupulous elements. This is according to the Comptroller-General of the Nigeria Customs Service (NCS), Colonel Hameed Ali, who also said it has become necessary to collect taxes on these illicit vehicles. In return these vehicles are then issued with papers effectively legitimising their resale. Ali alleged that many vehicles on display for sale in auto shops across the country were also smuggled.

According to Ali the country needs revenue for development, hence the need to collect duties on those smuggled vehicles.

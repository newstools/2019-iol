 It’s only 05:06 and I’m already waking up to Jessica Nkosi trending number 1, how sad . As much as y’all will try normalize cheating but this is not a nice feeling where no women/ men Should go through. It’s the the worst pain ever. Strength to you sis 🙏🏽 pic.twitter.com/7EcK4iYm8r   If Jessica Nkosi can get cheated on , everybody can get cheated on. Cheating is wrong, no need to justify it.  Beyonce once get cheated, kylier janner once cheated and now it jessica nkosi, who am i with a bank balance of R34🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️ pic.twitter.com/kGzKjgk5yO    Yah just goes to show that celebrity or not.Mjolo doesn’t discriminate 😂😂Agh Jessica Nkosi shame yazi😊🤦🏽‍♂️#FinishHer☠️   Umjolo Doesn't Have A VIP Section, We All In General Section 😂😂You Relax You Get Stumped ..Oh Jessica Nkosi 😂

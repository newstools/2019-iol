"President Ramaphosa has thanked the council members for accepting the invitation to serve South Africa’s development in their capacity as members of the Presidential Economic Advisory Council and assured them that their insights, critiques and recommendations will ultimately serve to build a sustainable and inclusive economy that meets the needs of citizens and is globally competitive at the same time." The council will be supported by a secretary to be drawn from National Treasury and the presidency's policy and research unit.

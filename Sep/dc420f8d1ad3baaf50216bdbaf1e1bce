Johannesburg - The Constitutional Court on Tuesday upheld a South Gauteng High Court ruling declaring corporal punishment at home illegal. The ruling comes months after Freedom of Religion South Africa (FOR SA), a non-profit Christian organisation, brought an application to the apex court to have the ruling that outright banned spanking set aside. The case landed in the Constitutional Court after the South Gauteng High Court last year found the defence of reasonable chastisement to be unconstitutional in a matter related to a father who had been found guilty of assaulting his 13-year old son for watching pornography. In the groundbreaking judgment delivered last October, Judge Raylene Keightley ruled that spanking children was unconstitutional. The high court found that a defence that allows parents to physically discipline their children violates children’s rights and that the protection of children from all forms of violence is critical in our context of alarmingly high levels of violence against children. At present, the common law defence of "reasonable chastisement" practically allows parents to hit their children with the justification of corporal punishment being a form of discipline. The Constitutional Court ruling paves the way for development of law to criminalise spanking. * This is a developing story

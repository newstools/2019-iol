Cape Town - The vigilance and quick response by South African Police Service (SAPS) officers and a private security company's officers led to the arrest of two armed robbery suspects shortly after a business was robbed in Milnerton in Cape Town on Sunday morning, Western Cape police said. "This morning [Sunday], five robbers held up staff at a computer store situated in a Milnerton mall and fled with computer equipment," Lt-Col Andrè Traut said. The robbers were pursued by members of the mall’s security and during a high speed pursuit, the robbers collided with a motorcyclist on the corner of Giel Basson and Uys Krige drives. "They proceed to flee, and on the corner of Giel Basson Drive and Voortrekker Road they again collided with another vehicle, whereafter they fled further on foot." Members of the Parow SAPS flying squad managed to arrest two of the suspects. The firearm used in the robbery, a 9mm pistol, and the stolen goods were retrieved. The three robbers who managed to evade arrest were being sought by police. The motorcyclist and the motorist involved in the two collisions were not seriously injured. Once charged, the two suspects were due to appear in the Cape Town Magistrates' Court on charges of armed robbery, possession of an unlicensed firearm, and reckless and/or negligent driving, Traut said.
